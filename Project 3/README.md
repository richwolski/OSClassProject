# CS170
Hello Jason.  I coouldn't quite figure out how to contact you directly so I'm hoping this might work.  As you might expect, it is difficult to create new OS assignments each quarter that allow the same implementation experience.  Your repo (from several years ago) is visible to the current class and is being used to cheat.  Would you please make this repo private (as we discussed when you took the class)?  It is difficult to preserve the investment in the class materials when students can simply use your code.  Thanks so much and I hope you are doing well.
